title: An Encora Academy experience
---

Hi there, reader (: My name is Salma and I'm a software engineer with a passion for exploring the mysteries of technology. I'm an open-minded person with a strong commitment to social justice and environmental care. Joining the Encora Apprenticeship program was a natural choice for me, as I'm eager to deepen my understanding of commercial and custom software development. Encora's emphasis on learning, feedback culture, growth, and professionalism offered me the perfect environment to reach my goals and flourish as a software engineer. 

Throughout this blog, I will be documenting the various programming tasks I encountered, providing technical logs with detailed information on how I completed each task, and reflecting on my personal experiences of the entire module in an essay post. So, join me on this journey as I explore the ups and downs of my learning process in Encora.
