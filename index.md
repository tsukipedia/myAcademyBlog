title: An Encora Academy experience

Hi there, reader (: My name is Salma and I'm a software engineer with a passion for exploring the mysteries of technology. I'm an open-minded person with a strong commitment to social justice and environmental care. I joined the Apprenticeship to deepen my understanding of commercial and custom software development. Encora, a large software company with a focus on learning, feedback culture, growth, and professionalism, provides the ideal environment for me to thrive and grow as a software engineer.
