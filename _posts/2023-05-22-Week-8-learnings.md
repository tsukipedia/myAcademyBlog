Over the course of this week, I embarked on a project using a library that I determined was not the best choice for my specific project, Redux. However, I deliberately chose this as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of its workings. Although it is better suited for larger projects, I believe that the insights I gained will prove valuable in my future endeavors. I was also able to refresh my understanding of React, as it had been six months since I last worked on a front-end project. This week served as a wonderful refresher course. As I continued with the development of the To-Do List App, React's usage came flooding back to me, and I found myself reacquainting with the various components, state management, and component lifecycle methods.

Reflecting on my university days, I've been contemplating the stark contrast between the "raw" Java distributed applications we built with manual data persistence and the modern frameworks available today. I vividly remember the complexity involved in establishing connections with databases or other applications. Comparing those experiences with the To-Do List project, I've been able to witness how frameworks have simplified the programming landscape. The complexity has been greatly reduced, thanks to the tools and libraries provided by frameworks, which allow for seamless integration and efficient management of databases. However, not being able to utilize a database while building the To-Do List app limited the potential of Spring's libraries. For instance, many JPA annotations are designed to simplify the development process by automatically handling common entity attributes such as ID and creation date. It is worth noting that this attribute management takes place exclusively when data is persisted, which means that manual handling is necessary for non-persistent data.

In addition to my exploration of frameworks, I also delved into new tools and technologies. One significant discovery was Vim, a text editor that I learned to use in the MacOS terminal to edit files. This newfound knowledge proved invaluable when I encountered environment configuration issues. This experience reinforced the importance of continuously expanding my skill set and adapting to new tools.

During the week, I encountered an issue that I initially attributed to Apache. To address this problem, I dedicated a significant amount of time to learning about common Apache errors and their solutions. However, after extensive investigation, I discovered that the root cause of the issue was actually related to Zscaler. It was through seeking assistance from a member of the IT team that I ultimately resolved the problem. This scenario served as a reminder of the importance of knowing when to seek help. I often find myself entangled in seemingly simple problems, attempting to solve them independently, only to realize that the most effective solution is to reach out for assistance in the first place. It is an ongoing challenge for me to strike the right balance between independent problem-solving and seeking guidance, but I recognize that growth in this area will come with patience and continued practice.

In conclusion, this week has been a valuable learning experience, filled with insights and discoveries. Despite the challenges encountered, I deepened my understanding of the inner workings of Spring, React, and MacOS. Additionally, I refreshed my knowledge of React and marveled at the evolution of frameworks that have simplified the development process. Finally, the experience of troubleshooting and seeking assistance reinforced the importance of knowing when to ask for help, a skill that I continue to develop. I look forward to applying the knowledge gained this week in future projects, building upon these experiences and striving for continuous improvement.
