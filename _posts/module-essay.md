title:  Takeaways of the "week" Essay

In this essay, I will discuss my key takeaways from this module while examining three of its learning objectives. The first objective I want to address is the notion that "Software engineering is more about dealing with people than dealing with computers." As a software engineer, I have encountered this statement before and have always been somewhat resistant to it. It is no secret that I am not much of a people person; however, throughout my education and professional career, I have come to accept my role. I am capable of tackling any software engineering challenge that comes my way with a positive attitude, even if it involves interacting with people. Nevertheless, I believe I would not be content spending most of my time conversing with non-developers and handling management tasks like senior engineers do.

This Apprenticeship module has involved the most management tasks so far, as it primarily focused on teamwork. Overall, I believe the team managed these tasks effectively, but I personally struggled. The main reason for this is my increasing burnout, which has led to a gradual decline in my productivity. To address this issue, I plan to incorporate the burnout factor into my time estimates for tasks and attempt to mitigate the slowdown of my productivity through meditation.

The team's communication was generally good, and I cannot think of any specific ways to improve it. However, the communication between my partner and me was not as effective, leading us to work twice as hard on most of the Code Jam problems. Improving communication is challenging if only one party is making an effort; both parties must commit to progress. Nevertheless, I felt comfortable talking to my partner and the entire team, and someone was always available when needed, even during unusual hours. I also appreciated the commitment and proactive attitude displayed by my fellow apprentices, as everyone was willing to take on extra work when necessary to complete our assignments on time and with quality. I am eager to see if this positive attitude persists in future team tasks and would love to experience a similar dynamic when working with clients.

The second learning objective I want to discuss is "A rock-solid grasp of computer science fundamentals." While the algorithmic challenges in this module required knowledge of programming logic, data structures, optimization, and compilation quirks, I do not believe the exercises alone provided this knowledge. Instead, I feel we already possessed most of this understanding and simply had to apply it. Nevertheless, the way we shared our knowledge with the rest of the team was valuable and leads me to the third learning objective I want to address: "Knowledge of how to learn."

During my academic life, I seldom relied on classmates for help, as many were unwilling to take on extra work to assist me. Instead, I turned to teachers, who, despite their busy schedules, were often eager to help and provided valuable, trustworthy information. In my professional life, I have relied more on research to address challenges I am unsure of how to solve. While research offers a wealth of information and the convenience of the internet, not everything found online is reliable, follows best practices, or is specifically designed to help you. In this module, I found myself relying on research for more general inquiries and on my fellow apprentices for more specific questions. This balanced approach to learning felt more effective, and I aim to take advantage of it in future Apprenticeship modules.

In conclusion, this module has taught me valuable lessons about the importance of communication, teamwork, and balancing different learning methods. While I have experienced personal challenges in areas like burnout and communication, I am committed to finding ways to overcome them and improve my performance. The collaboration and knowledge-sharing among my fellow apprentices have proven to be an effective way to learn and grow, and I look forward to continuing to develop my skills in future Apprenticeship modules. By embracing the lessons learned from this experience, I am confident that I can become a more effective software engineer, adept at both technical and interpersonal aspects of the profession.
