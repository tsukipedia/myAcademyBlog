During this module in the academy, I experienced an enriching journey of discovery that explored the process of crafting a practical tool that could potentially streamline aspects of my daily life. The project we embarked upon bore a striking resemblance to an Excel spreadsheet I maintain as a personal expense diary. This parallel evoked amusement, given my habitual complaints about businesses that insist on using Excel files for persisting data. Yet, as I delved deeper into the development of this simple ledger implementation, I found myself enthused by the possibility of creating a Command Line Interface (CLI) to track my expenses and income in a more sophisticated and organized manner.

However, the journey was not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in the task's requirements was a significant obstacle, requiring multiple readings and intense inspection to grasp the essence of what was expected of me. The uncertainty that persisted, even after exhaustive efforts to comprehend the task, was frustrating. I found myself questioning whether I had correctly interpreted the task or if the final product I was presenting was fundamentally flawed.

I understand that encountering and managing unclear requirements is a hallmark of agile development. It's a skill that we must hone to succeed in this fast-paced, iterative software development methodology. However, in a typical agile setup, we would have the opportunity to seek clarification from project managers or product owners. For this task, I felt that support from the apprentice team was lacking. Queries from my fellow apprentices about the project went unanswered or responses were tardy, which further exacerbated the frustration.

Additionally, I struggled with my decision to opt for JavaScript/NodeJS as the language for the project. My choice was entirely self-made, and yet, I found myself wrestling with the limitations of dynamically typed languages, something I have never been particularly fond of. Despite these challenges, I chose JavaScript because I believed it would provide the simplest route to creating a CLI. While my belief remains unshaken, there were numerous moments during the development process when I wondered if I could have taken a different approach, perhaps there was a way of substituting JavaScript with TypeScript.

In hindsight, despite the trials and tribulations, this module has provided a rich learning experience. It has not only improved my technical skills but also imparted valuable lessons on handling ambiguity and making strategic decisions in programming (or at least I think so xd). The experience has been challenging yet rewarding, and I look forward to applying these lessons in my future endeavors.
