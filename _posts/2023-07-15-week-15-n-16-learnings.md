The past two weeks I have delved into some data engineering topics. I learned about facets, an aspect or view of data in multi-dimensional analysis, grasping these concepts solidifies my foundation in data analysis. Another topic I explored was data reconciliation, a process that verifies the accuracy, completeness and consistency of data. Understanding this process not only reinforces my comprehension of data integrity but also underlines the importance of accuracy in data-driven decision making - a cornerstone in AI and Machine Learning applications.

Throughout this period, I understood that it's best to allow exceptions to propagate up to a high level of your application, where logging and user messaging should be handled. Additionally, I learned about the `instanceof` operator in Java and how it's handy in tests, although its use in the main codebase can indicate poor design. This understanding is useful for writing tests and detecting code smells. In testing, I also honed my skills using the TestNG library to write unit test for one of my open source contribution. Specifically, I learned to test exceptions in failing use cases, enhancing my capability to write robust and fail-safe code.

While building on my JavaScript knowledge, I learned about JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance and its potential pitfalls. This knowledge is invaluable as a full-stack developer and will help me be do better front-end developments.

The emphasis on data accuracy and visualization, the enhanced JavaScript and Java skills, the improved exception handling and testing practices, all contribute to my growth as a full-stack developer and aspiring AI specialist. While also being instrumental in developing efficient, robust, and maintainable software.
