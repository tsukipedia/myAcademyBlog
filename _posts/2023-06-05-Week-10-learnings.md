This week, I had the opportunity to refresh my knowledge of programming concepts with Java through the Hyperskill lessons. It was a great refresher to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals. Additionally, I came across some interesting and lesser-known Java features, such as utilizing underscores to separate groups of digits within a number (e.g., int million = 1_000_000). This newfound knowledges will undoubtedly help me write cleaner and more readable code in the future.

In addition to programming, I discovered the key concepts of lightning talks, what they are, why they hold value, and how to effectively organize and deliver a lightning talk. I'm planning to put it into practice this week by preparing and delivering my very first lightning talk. I intend to share my expertise and research on RESTful APIs in an engaging and informative manner, leveraging educational resources to ensure a captivating presentation. With this, I hope to not only enhance my public speaking skills but also share my knowledge in a way that entertains and enlightens the audience. I'm eager to make the most of this opportunity and contribute to the exchange of knowledge within our community.
